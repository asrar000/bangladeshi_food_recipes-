        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The shingara’s ancestor, the Samsa, originated in Central Asia before the 10th century. It was brought to the Indian subcontinent by Middle Eastern traders and chefs during the Delhi Sultanate (13th–14th century). While it began as a meat-filled snack for travelers, it evolved in Bengal into the potato-filled, flaky pastry we love today after the Portuguese introduced potatoes to the region in the 16th century.</p>
